            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>An adaptable maths teacher, with professional and effective techniques on helping students learn and understand GCSE maths. 

                Now, more than ever we are in a place where we have never been before and students require additional guidance with their education. All students have a different learning method and through tuition I encourage my students to explore this through different methods to find what is best for them. 
                
                I am very flexible in terms of timings and teaching methods and can teach students of all abilities, and I strongly believe that we all have the ability to succeed.
