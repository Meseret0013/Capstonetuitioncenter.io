        <h3 style="padding-left: 0.5cm;">English</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 0.5cm;">English is usually taught in ability sets in KS3 (Years 7, 8 and 9). The curriculum will be the same, but higher sets will be working at a higher level, while lower sets will be given more support. 

            The main aim of the English curriculum is to promote high standards of language and literacy by equipping pupils with a strong command of the spoken and written word, and to develop their love of literature through reading for enjoyment across a wide range of styles and genres.
            
            There are four separate areas in English we focus on here at Capstone Education:
             
            
        </p>
            <ul>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Writing</li>
<li>Grammar and vocabulary</li>
<li>Spoken English</li>
            </ul><br><br>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 0.5cm;">Maths</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 0.5cm;">Maths is usually taught in ability sets in KS3. Children will use mental, mathematical reasoning and problem-solving. Here at Capstone we cover: </p> <ul>
            <li>KS3 number Place value and fractions </li>
            <li>Rounding up/down Approximation</li>

        KS4 Years 10 and 11
    </h1><br>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 0.5cm;">English</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 0.5cm;">We aim to teach a wide range of skills in line with the National Curriculum, whilst offering a stimulating
        framework which captures the enthusiasm and enjoyment of English for students of all abilities. Our
        key goal is to empower pupils to understand how language gives an insight into what the world
        means, how we make sense of it through language and how we understand others’ views and
        construct our own identity. Through this, we can support all students in achieving their potential.
        We embed key GCSE skills and Functional Skills from year 10 to enable students to master these
        skills as they move towards year 11. These include:</p> <ul>
            <li>Language analysis</li>
            <li>Word level identification</li>
            <li>Spelling, punctuation and grammar (SPAG)</li>
            <li>How to structure your own writing for effect</li>
        </ul><br><br>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 0.5cm;">Maths</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 0.5cm;">GCSE maths is a demanding subject and the syllabus covers a number of subjects. If you’re overwhelmed by the task that lies ahead, you’re in the right place. At Capstone Education, we publish GCSE maths revision packs and have plenty of experience about how to perform well in the exam. We delve a little deeper into the GCSE maths syllabus, helping you to prepare for the exam.</p>
